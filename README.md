# Design Patterns

## Creational
- ### Factory Method
  - *Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.*
  - Enable the extensible creation of variabilities such as commands, iterators, and visitors.
  - #### Benefits
    - Decouples the implementation of the product from its use.
    - Clients are more flexible since they don't need to specify the class name of the concrete class and the details of its creation.
    - Adding new variants does not affect existing client code.
  - #### Uses and drawbacks
    - When the class cannot anticipate the objects it must create.
    - When the class wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates.
    - When there's a need to decouple object creation from its subsequent use. 
    - Construction of objects may require additional classes.
- Abstract Factory
- ### Builder
  - *Encapsulate the construction of a product and allow it to be constructed in steps. Separates construction of a complex object from its representation.*
  - #### Benefits
    - Isolates the code from construction and representation.
    - Fine control over construction process. Allows objects to be constructed in a multistep and varying process (as opposed to one-step factories).
    - Hides internal representation of the product from the client.
    - Product implementations can be swapped in and out because the client only sees an abstract interface.
  - #### Uses and drawbacks
    - When you need to follow a sequence of potentially complex steps to create an object.
    - Allow different implementations and internal interfaces of an object.
    - Goes nicely with interpreter pattern (compound).
    - May involve a lot of classes and class interdependencies.
    - Constructing objects requires more domain knowledge of the client than when using a Factory.

## Structural
- Decorator
- ### Composite
  - *Build structures of objects in the form of trees to represent part-whole hierarchies that contain both compositions of objects and individual objects as nodes. Using a composite structure, we can apply the same operations over both composites and individual objects, ignoring the differences between composites and individual objects.*
  - #### Benefits
    - Treat individual objects and multiple, recursively-composed objects uniformly regardless of complexity and behavior.
    - No distinction between individual and composed elements. 
    - New component subclasses work wherever existing ones do.
    - Classes only include fields and methods they need.
  - #### Uses and drawbacks 
    - Let clients treat individual objects and compositions as objects uniformly.
    - Perceived complexity. May need what seems a large number of classes and objects.
    - Bloated interfaces for composites and leaves. Leaf inherits methods it doesn't need.
- ### Bridge
  - *Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. This means to create a bridge interface to separate out responsibilities into different abstract classes.*
  - Encapsulate variability behind a stable API that creates separate class hierarchies for an abstraction and its implementations. Client calls to the abstraction are forwarded to the corresponding implementor subclass.
  - The Bridge pattern is an application of the old advice, “prefer composition over inheritance”. 
  - #### Benefits
    - Decouples an implementation so that it is not bound permanently to an interface.
    - Abstraction and implementation can be extended independently.
    - Changes to concrete abstraction classes don't affect the client.
  - #### Uses and drawbacks 
    - Useful any time you need to vary an interface and an implementation in different ways.
    - Useful in graphics and windowing systems that need to run over multiple platforms.
    - When there's a need to change implementor hierarchies at design-time or runtime without breaking client code. 
    - Increases complexity.
	
## Behavioral
- ### Strategy
  - *Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
  - Change behaviors transparently. Encapsulate variability of behaviors via a common API whose implementations can be changed transparently with respect to clients.
  - #### Benefits
    - Decouples the interface of a behavior from its implementation. It creates an abstraction that makes it easy to select and exchange behaviors.
    - Greater flexibility and reuse.
    - Behaviors can change dynamically.
  - #### Uses and drawbacks
    - When an object should be configurable at runtime with one of many algorithms and all algorithms can be encapsulated and one interface covers all encapsulations.
    - Use as an alternative to subclassing.
    - Overhead of strategy creation and communication. Strategy can increase the number of objects created in a program. 
    - Semantic incompatibility of multiple strategies used together inconsistently. May require other patterns such as abstract factory so groups of strategies that require semantic coherence evolve in a consistent way (concurrent or distributed systems).
- Observer
- ### Command
  - *Encapsulate the request for a service as an object, thereby letting you parameterize other objects with different requests, queue or logs requests, and support undoable operations.*
  - Define objectified actions that enables users to perform command requests consistently and extensibly.
  - Provides a common API for user-request commands.
  - #### Benefits
    - Decouples an object making a request from the one that knows how to perform it.
    - Abstracts the executor of a service making the program more modular and flexible.
    - Can bundle state and behavior in one object or forward behavior to other objects.
    - Can extend behavior via subclassing.
    - Can pass a command object as a parameter.
    - Composition yields macro commands. Macro commands are a simple extension of Command that allow multiple commands to be invoked.
    - Supports arbitrary level undo-redo.
  - #### Uses and drawbacks
    - Implement logging, undo(), and transactional systems.
    - Drawing editors, Microsoft Office tools, GNU Emacs.
    - Might result in lots of trivial command subclasses.
    - Excessive memory may be needed to support undo/redo operations.
    - Avoiding error accumulation during undo/redo in numerical analysis applications.
- ### Iterator
  - *Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation*
  - It also places the task of traversal on the iterator object, not on the aggregate, which simplifies the aggregate interface and implementation, and places the responsibility where it should be.
  - #### Benefits
    - Flexibility. Aggregate and traversal objects are decoupled and can evolve separately.
    - Multiplicity. Supports multiple iterators and traversal algorithms.
  - #### Uses and drawbacks
    - When you require multiple traversal algorithms over an aggregate.
    - When you require a uniform traversal interface over different aggregates.
    - When aggregate classes and traversal algorithms must vary independently.
    - Overhead. Additional communication between iterator and aggregate. Problematic for iterators in concurrent or distributed systems.
    - Dependencies. The iterator implementation may depend on aggregate's implementation.  
- ### State
  - *Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class without changing its API.
  - Represents a state as a full-blown class. The context gets its behavior by delegating to the current state object it is composed with.
  - Allows a Context to change its behavior as the state of the Context changes. This is different from Strategy which typically configures Context classes with a behavior or algorithm. Strategy doesn't have clients accessing the methods through context which is used to store data from the "one size fits all" interface the strategy exposes.
  - #### Benefits
    - By encapsulating each state into a class, we localize any changes that will need to be made and partition behavior for different states.
    - State transitions can be controlled by the State classes or by the Context classes.
  - #### Uses and drawbacks
    - When an object must change its behavior at runtime depending on which state it is in.
    - When several operations have the same large multi-part conditional structure that depends on the object's state.
    - Will typically result in a greater number of classes in your design.
    - Dependencies and interactions may be hard to understand and evolve if they aren't well documented (& if the State pattern isn't well understood)
- ### Template Method
  - *Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. The Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.
  - Subclasses can "hook into" the algorithm at various points, if they wish through a hook method; a subclass is also free to ignore the hook. Hook methods do nothing or default behavior in the abstract class, but may be overriden in the subclass.
  - The Hollywood Principle guides us to put decision making in high-level modules that can decide how and when to call low-level modules.
  - Similar to strategy as both encapsulate algorithms, one by inheritance and the other by composition.
  - The factory method is a specialization of Template method.
  - ### Benefits
    - Enables inversion of control (Hollywood Principle).
    - Overriding rules are enforced via subclassing.
    - Promotes code reuse.
  - ### Uses and drawbacks 
    - When you need to implement invariant aspects of an algorithm once and let subclasses define variant parts. 
    - When you want to localize common behavior in a class to enhance reuse.
    - When you want to handle variations by subclassing.
    - Must subclass to specialize behavior, which can yield many subclasses. Solves same problems as strategy pattern but in a different way.
