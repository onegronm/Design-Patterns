         * If we have multiple consecutive arguments of the same type, it's easy to accidentally swap them around. 
         * Since the compiler doesn't pick it up as an error, it can manifest as an issue somewhere down the line at 
         * runtime – and that can turn into a tricky debugging exercise. In addition, adding more constructor parameters 
         * results in code that becomes harder to read . If we had 10 different parameters, it would become very difficult
         * to identify what's what in the constructor at a single glance. To make it worse, some of those values might be
         * optional, which means that we'll need to create a bunch of overloaded constructors to deal with all possible 
         * combinations, or we'll have to pass nulls to our constructor (ugly!)
         * there are two specific problems that we need to solve:
            - Too many constructor arguments.
            - Incorrect object state.

            Builder pattern allows us to write readable, understandable code to set up complex objects. It is often implemented with a fluent interface
